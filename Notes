# Step 1: Create SQS Queue and Configure CloudWatch Events to send ECS events to the SQS Queue

Blox depends on an ECS event stream that is delivered via CloudWatch events. In order to use Blox,
you need to create an SQS queue and configure CloudWatch to deliver the ECS events to this SQS queue.
Blox provides a pre-built AWS CloudFormation template that will deploy and configure the required Amazon AWS components.
Once you have pulled the CloudFormation template from the Blox repository, run the following command using the AWS CLI:

aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name BloxLocal-AWSComponents --template-body file://cloudformation_template.json --profile xpeppers-test

# Step 2: Launch Blox

Next, download the Docker Compose file from the Blox repo.
Before launching Blox, you will first need to update docker-compose.yml with the following changes:
- Update the AWS_REGION value with the region of your ECS and SQS resources.
- Update the AWS_PROFILE value with your profile name
